Shai's place is fantastic. It's a huge loft space by New York standards nicely but sparsely furnished so lots of empty space to do yoga and run around in. Beautiful light, views, sunsets and lots of greenery and plants. Everything you need right on the edge of one of Brooklyn's best neighborhoods-Clinton Hill and Fort greene. Great shops and restaurants close by and convenient to subway. Great value for the money. All in all, a lucky find if you get it, book it fast.
